**Subject**: Daily Standup Summary - Action Items & Sprint Review Status (Jan 15)

Hi Team,

Thanks for today's standup. Here's a summary of our discussion, action items, and critical decisions we need to make.

### 🎯 Key Takeaways

**Sprint Review Status**: We have a potential blocker for Friday's demo. Mike's API integration will take 2-3 days, which may push past our sprint review timeline. **Sarah, can you confirm if we should proceed with Friday or reschedule?**

**Production Issues**: We identified two urgent production issues that need immediate attention:
- Database performance degradation (Tom investigating)
- Memory leak in payment service (possibly related to auth work)

**This Weekend**: Server migration is on track. **Everyone must complete staging testing by Thursday.**

   - Option B: Reschedule to next week (full scope)
   - **Sarah, please decide by EOD Wednesday**

2. **Production Issues Priority**: Should we prioritize production fixes over new features?
   - Memory leak and database issues are affecting production
   - **Team, let's discuss in tomorrow's standup**

3. **AWS Cost Review**: 30% increase needs investigation
   - **Tom, can you provide preliminary findings by Friday?**
   - May need separate meeting to review and optimize
