# Specification Quality Checklist: Silver Tier Functional Assistant

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-01-15
**Feature**: [Silver Tier Specification](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) - *Exceptions made for hackathon-mandated tech stack (Obsidian, Claude, PM2)*
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details) - *Exceptions made for hackathon-mandated constraints*
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- The specification includes references to specific technologies (Obsidian, PM2, Python, etc.) because the hackathon requirements explicitly mandate this tech stack. These are treated as constraints rather than incidental implementation details.
