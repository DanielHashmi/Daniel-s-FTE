# Phase 0: Research Findings

## 1. Process Management Architecture
**Decision**: Use PM2 with `ecosystem.config.js` generated by `watcher-manager` skill.
**Rationale**: PM2 provides built-in autorestart, logging, and monitoring (FR-009, FR-010).
**Alternatives**:
- `supervisord`: Good but configuration is less dynamic than JS-based PM2 config.
- `systemd`: Too complex for user-level installation and management.
- Custom python loop: Re-inventing the wheel for process lifecycle.

## 2. Orchestration Pattern
**Decision**: `orchestrator.py` as a master loop running under PM2.
**Function**:
- Monitors file system events (or polls) for `Needs_Action` and `Pending_Approval` changes.
- Triggers `/process-inbox` skill when action files appear.
- Monitors `Completed` actions to trigger next steps in Plans.
- Runs `watchdog` logic implies checking PM2 status (via `pm2 list` or API).
**Rationale**: Centralized control logic compliant with FR-035. Separates "doing" (Skills) from "coordinating" (Orchestrator).

## 3. MCP Server Integration
**Decision**: Build standalone Python MCP servers (`email_server.py`, `linkedin_server.py`) using `mcp` library.
**Pattern**:
- Servers start as PM2 processes.
- Skills (`email-ops`, `social-ops`) connect to them via MCP Client (stdio or SSE).
- *Fallback*: Skills currently implement direct logic/DRY_RUN.
- *Refinement*: For Silver Tier, we will prioritize direct logic in Skills for simplicity (complying with "All AI functionality as Agent Skills" FR-044) BUT wrapping them as MCP servers is required by FR-027.
- *Hybrid Approach*: The Skill script *is* the client. The Server runs in background.

## 4. Human-In-The-Loop (HITL) storage
**Decision**: File-based state machine in `AI_Employee_Vault`.
- `Pending_Approval/`: Request files.
- `Approved/`: User moves files here to approve.
- `Rejected/`: User moves files here to reject.
**Rationale**: Non-blocking, simpler than an interactive CLI prompts, leverages OS file explorer as UI (FR-193).

## 5. Security - Credentials
**Decision**: `.env` file loaded by `python-dotenv`.
**Key names**: `GMAIL_CLIENT_SECRET`, `LINKEDIN_ACCESS_TOKEN`, `OPENAI_API_KEY` (if used).
**Rationale**: Standard practice, keeps secrets out of code (FR-008 implies logging errors, but implies we handle credentials safely).

## 6. Resolved Clarifications
- **Orchestrator vs Watchdog**: Orchestrator performs coordination; Watchdog (FR-013) is a specific function (possibly sub-thread or separate script) ensuring health. Decision: Watchdog runs as separate thread inside Orchestrator or separate PM2 process. We will implement it as a function within `orchestrator.py` that runs every 60s.
